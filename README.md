# Connected-Particles

![Demo_Preview](media/connected-particles_demo.gif)

Simple program with **_N_** particles/points that collide with the limits of the innerWindow.
<br>
Each particle is connected to the others.
<br>
Depending on the distance between 2 particles their connecting line changes: the closer they are, the higher the value of ALPHA.

This results in an interesting effect :)
